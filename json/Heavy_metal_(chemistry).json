{"cursor":"6383","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'heavy metal' is a member of a loosely defined subset of elements that exhibit\nmetallic properties. It mainly includes the transition metals, some metalloids,\nlanthanides, and actinides. Many different definitions have been proposedâsome\nbased on density, some on atomic number or atomic weight, and some on chemical\nproperties or toxicity. The term heavy metal has been called\na \"misinterpretation\" in an IUPAC technical report due to the contradictory\ndefinitions and its lack of a \"coherent scientific basis\". John\nH. Duffus \"\"Heavy metals\" a meaningless term? (IUPAC Technical Report)\" Pure and\nApplied Chemistry, 2002, Vol. 74, pp. 793â807.  There is an alternative\nterm [[toxic metal]], for which no consensus of exact definition exists either.\nAs discussed below, depending on context, heavy metal can include elements\nlighter than carbon and can exclude some of the heaviest metals. Heavy metals\noccur naturally in the ecosystem with large variations in concentration. In\nmodern times, anthropogenic sources of heavy metals, i.e. pollution, have been\nintroduced to the ecosystem. Waste-derived fuels are especially prone to contain\nheavy metals, so heavy metals are a concern in consideration of waste as fuel.\n","linknr":204,"url":"Heavy_metal_(chemistry)","recorded":1362511286,"links":43,"instances":["nuclear_fuel","element"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical element groups","Toxicology"],"headings":["Relationship to living organisms","Heavy metal pollution","Medicine","Hazardous materials","Nuclear technology","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["mercury","element"],["mercury","element"],["cladding","nuclear_fuel"]],"members":["cladding","mercury"],"related":["Transition_metal","Metalloid","Lanthanide","Actinide","Density","Atomic_number","Atomic_weight","Chemical_properties","Toxic_metal","IUPAC","Iron","Cobalt","Copper","Manganese","Molybdenum","Zinc","Humans","Mercury_(element)","Plutonium","Lead","Toxic_metal","Animal","Vanadium","Tungsten","Cadmium","TKK","Smelting","Nuclear_fuel","Cadmium","Soil_contaminant","Bay_mud","Bioaccumulation","Biomagnification","Coastal_fish","Smooth_toadfish","Seabird","Atlantic_Puffin","Toxic_metal","Iron","Manganese","Aluminium","Mercury_(element)","Cadmium","Beryllium","Arsenic","Bismuth","Minamata_disease","Mercury_poisoning","Itai-itai_disease","Cadmium_poisoning","Hazardous_materials","Burnup","Nuclear_fuel","Gigawatt","Metric_ton","Actinide","Thorium","Uranium","Plutonium","Fissile","Fertile_material","Cladding_(nuclear_fuel)","Zirconium","Light_metal","Microwave_digestion"]}
