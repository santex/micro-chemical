The feature that is most often the cause of chirality in molecules is the\npresence of an asymmetric carbon atom. Organic Chemistry (4th Edition) Paula\nY. Bruice. Organic Chemistry (3rd Edition) Marye Anne Fox ,James K.\nWhitesell.\n\nThe term 'chiral' in general is used to describe an object that is not\nsuperimposable on its mirror image. 'Achiral' (not chiral)\nobjects are objects that are identical to their mirror image. Human hands are\nperhaps the most universally recognized example of chirality. The term chirality\nis derived from the Greek word for hand, ÏÎµÎ¹Ï (kheir). It is a mathematical\napproach to the concept of \"handedness\".\n\nIn chemistry, chirality usually refers to molecules. Two mirror images of a\nchiral molecule are called enantiomers or optical isomers. Pairs of enantiomers\nare often designated as \"right-\" and \"left-handed\".\n\nMolecular chirality is of interest because of its application to stereochemistry\nin inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, biochemistry, and\nsupramolecular chemistry.\n","linknr":416,"url":"Chirality_(chemistry)","recorded":1362508285,"links":48,"instances":["letter","chemistry","nerve_agent","mathematics"],"pdf":["http://www.leffingwell.com/download/chirality-phamacology.pdf"],"categories":["Stereochemistry","Polarization","Symmetry","Chirality","Chemical nomenclature"],"headings":["History","Symmetry","Naming conventions","Nomenclature","Stereogenic centers","Properties of enantiomers","In biology","Inorganic chemistry","Chirality of compounds with a stereogenic \"lone pair\"","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Chirality_with_hands.svg/300px-Chirality_with_hands.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Betaine-Alanine.png/300px-Betaine-Alanine.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/%C3%89nantiom%C3%A8res_octa%C3%A8driques.jpg/400px-%C3%89nantiom%C3%A8res_octa%C3%A8driques.jpg","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Amine_R-N.svg/144px-Amine_R-N.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Amine_N-R.svg/144px-Amine_N-R.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["chirality","mathematics"],["vx","nerve_agent"],["tris(bipyridineruthenium(ii_chloride"],["cis-dichlorobis(ethylenediaminecobalt(iii_chloride"],["complex","chemistry"],["tris(bipyridineruthenium(ii_chloride"],["delta","letter"],["chirality","physics"],["chirality","mathematics"]],"members":["delta","complex","vx","chirality"],"related":["Molecule","Mirror_image","Chirality","Asymmetric_carbon","Hand","Enantiomer","Isomer","Right-handed","Stereochemistry","Inorganic_chemistry","Organic_chemistry","Physical_chemistry","Biochemistry","Supramolecular_chemistry","Levorotation_and_dextrorotation","Polarized_light","Counterclockwise","Levorotatory","Dextrorotatory","Jean-Baptiste_Biot","Louis_Pasteur","Microwave","Jagadish_Chandra_Bose","Lord_Kelvin","Symmetry","Improper_rotation","Rotation","Chirality_(mathematics)","Tetrahedral_molecular_geometry","Substituent","Symmetry_element","Rotational_symmetry","Glyceraldehyde","Cahn–Ingold–Prelog_priority_rules","Diastereomer","Serine","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","Pure_Appl._Chem.","Glyceraldehyde","Small_caps","Alanine","Glycine","Dextrorotatory","Levorotatory","Racemic","Enantiomeric_excess","Meso_compound","1,1'-bi-2-naphthol","Propadiene","BINAP","Axial_chirality","Cyclooctene","Planar_chirality","Calixarenes","Fullerenes","Inherent_chirality","Adamantane","Tetrahedrane","Levorotation_and_dextrorotation","Cryptochirality","Benzyl_alcohol","Deuterium","Coordination_compound","Phosphate","Phosphine","Serine","Glyceraldehyde","Sarin","VX_(nerve_agent)","Esomeprazole","Armodafinil","Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)_chloride","Cis-Dichlorobis(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III)_chloride","Hexol","Threonine","Isoleucine","Tröger's_base","Adenosine_triphosphate","DIPAMP","Dithionous_acid","Met-enkephalin","Leu-enkephalin","DNA","Thin_layer_chromatography","High-performance_liquid_chromatography","Infrared_spectroscopy","Quartz","EuFOD","Optical_activity","Circular_dichroism","CD_spectroscopy","Polarimetry","Amino_acid","Protein","Sugar","Homochirality","Biology","Enzyme","Spearmint","Caraway","Carvone","Sensory_receptor","Complex_(chemistry)","Hexol","Alfred_Werner","Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II)_chloride","Lambda","Delta_(letter)","Quartz","Amine","Phosphine","Sulfonium","Oxonium_ion","Sulfoxide","Carbanion","Asymmetric_synthesis","Amine","Nitrogen_inversion","KJ/mol","Tröger's_base","Stereochemistry","Supramolecular_chirality","Chirality_(physics)","Chirality_(mathematics)","Pfeiffer_Effect","Chemical_chirality_in_popular_fiction"]}
