{"cursor":"9341","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"]] 'Cycloalkanes' (also called 'naphthenes' - not to be confused with\nnaphthalene) are types of alkanes that have one or more rings of carbon atoms in\nthe chemical structure of their molecules. Alkanes are types of organic\nhydrocarbon compounds that have only single chemical bonds in their chemical\nstructure. Cycloalkanes consist of only carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms and\nare saturated because there are no multiple C-C bonds to hydrogenate (add more\nhydrogen to). A general chemical formula for cycloalkanes would be 'C nH 2(n+1-\ng) ' where 'n' = number of C atoms and 'g' = number of rings in the\nmolecule. Cycloalkanes with a single ring are named analogously to their normal\nalkane counterpart of the same carbon count: cyclopropane, cyclobutane,\ncyclopentane, cyclohexane, etc. The larger cycloalkanes, with greater than 20\n carbon\natoms are typically called cycloparaffins.\n\nCycloalkanes are classified into small, common, medium, and large cycloalkanes,\nwhere cyclopropane and cyclobutane are the small ones, cyclopentane,\ncyclohexane, cycloheptane are the common ones, cyclooctane through\ncyclotridecane are the medium ones, and the rest are the larger ones. \n","linknr":214,"url":"Ring_(chemistry)","recorded":1362687895,"links":49,"instances":[],"pdf":["http://www.westminster.edu/staff/Kailbw/CH2b.pdf"],"categories":["Cycloalkanes"],"headings":["Nomenclature","Properties","Ring strain","Reactions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0e/Cyclobutane-buckled-3D-balls.png/220px-Cyclobutane-buckled-3D-balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Norbornane-2D-skeletal.png/220px-Norbornane-2D-skeletal.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Naphthalene","Alkane","Carbon","Atom","Chemical_structure","Molecule","Organic_compound","Hydrocarbon","Chemical_compound","Chemical_bond","Hydrogen","Hydrogenation","Chemical_formula","Alkane","Cyclopropane","Cyclobutane","Cyclopentane","Cyclohexane","Paraffin","Bicyclic_compound","Spiro_compound","Terpineol","Boiling_point","Melting_point","Density","London_forces","Orbital_hybridization","Tetrahedral_angle","Standard_enthalpy_change_of_combustion","Average_bond_energies","Cyclopropane","Cyclobutane","Cyclopentane","Cyclohexane","Alkanes","Radical_substitution","Baeyer_strain_theory","Ring_strain","Alkenes","Electrophilic_addition","Nucleophilic_aliphatic_substitution","Alkyl_cycloalkane","Diels-Alder_reaction","Catalytic_hydrogenation","Cycloalkene","Encyclopædia_Britannica","Westminster_College,_Pennsylvania"]}
