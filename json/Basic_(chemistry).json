A soluble base is\nreferred to as an '[[alkali]]' if it contains and releases hydroxide ions ()\nquantitatively. The BrÃ¸nsted-Lowry theory defines bases as proton (hydrogen ion)\nacceptors, while the more general Lewis theory defines bases as electron pair\ndonors, allowing other Lewis acids than protons to be included. Chemistry, 9th Edition. Kenneth W. Whitten, Larry Peck,\nRaymond E. Davis, Lisa Lockwood, George G. Stanley. (2009) ISBN 0-495-39163-8.\nPage 363 The oldest Arrhenius theory defines bases as hydroxide\nanions, Chemistry. Page 349 which is strictly applicable only to\nalkali. In water, by altering the autoionization equilibrium, bases give\nsolutions with a hydrogen ion activity lower than that of pure water, i.e., a pH\nhigher than 7.0 at standard conditions. Examples of common bases are sodium\nhydroxide and ammonia. Metal oxides, hydroxides and especially alkoxides are\nbasic, and counteranions of weak acids are weak bases.\n\nBases can be thought of as the chemical opposite of acids. A reaction between an\nacid and base is called neutralization. Bases and acids are seen as opposites\nbecause the effect of an acid is to increase the hydronium ion () concentration\nin water, whereas bases reduce this concentration. Bases and acids are typically\nfound in aqueous solution forms. Aqueous solutions of bases react with aqueous\nsolutions of acids to produce water and salts in aqueous solutions in which the\nsalts separate into their component ions. If the aqueous solution is a saturated\nsolution with respect to a given salt solute any additional such salt present in\nthe solution will result in formation of a precipitate of the salt.\n","linknr":325,"url":"Basic_(chemistry)","recorded":1362372412,"links":87,"instances":["chemistry","unit","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical compounds","Bases"],"headings":["Definitions","Properties","Bases and pH","Neutralization of acids","Alkalinity of non-hydroxides","Strong bases","Bases as catalysts","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["activity","chemistry"],["neutralization","chemistry"],["mole","unit"],["mole","unit"],["resonance","chemistry"],["lithium_bis(trimethylsilylamide"]],"members":["neutralization","mole","activity","resonance"],"related":["Chemistry","Hydrogen_cation","Protons","Valence_electrons","Ions","Stoichiometry","Proton","Electron_pair","Lewis_acid","Svante_Arrhenius","Hydroxide","Anions","Self-ionization_of_water","Chemical_equilibrium","Activity_(chemistry)","PH","Sodium_hydroxide","Ammonia","Oxide","Hydroxide","Alkoxide","Weak_acid","Acid","Neutralization_(chemistry)","Hydronium_ion","Concentration","Aqueous_solution","Water","Salts","Saturated_solution","Solvent","Precipitate","Hydrolysis","Corrosive","Causticity","Superbase","Non-nucleophilic_base","Nucleophile","Weak_base","Alkali","Acid-base_reaction_theories","Guillaume_François_Rouelle","Acetic_acid","Saponification","Lipids","Causticity","PH_indicator","PH","Acidity","Molarity","Mole_(unit)","Self-ionization_of_water","Mole_(unit)","Alkalinity","Hydrogen_chloride","Table_salt","Sodium_hydroxide","Potassium_hydroxide","Sodium_carbonate","Ammonia","Protic_solvent","Carbon","Nitrogen","Oxygen","N-Butyllithium","Alkoxide","Amide","Sodium_amide","Resonance_(chemistry)","Superbase","Sodium_acetate","Weak_base","Potassium_hydroxide","Barium_hydroxide","Cesium_hydroxide","Sodium_hydroxide","Strontium_hydroxide","Calcium_hydroxide","Lithium_hydroxide","Rubidium_hydroxide","Conjugate_base","Superbase","N-Butyllithium","Lithium_diisopropylamide","Lithium_diethylamide","Sodium_amide","Sodium_hydride","Lithium_bis(trimethylsilyl)amide","Solubility","Catalyst","Chemical_reaction","Magnesium_oxide","Calcium_oxide","Barium_oxide","Potassium_fluoride_on_alumina","Zeolite","Transition_metal","Hydrogenation","Double_bond","Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley_reduction","Michael_reaction","Acid","Acid-base_reaction","Base-richness","Conjugate_base","Titration"]}
