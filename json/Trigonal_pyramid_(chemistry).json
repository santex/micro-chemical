When all three atoms at\nthe corners are identical, the molecule belongs to point group C 3v .\nSome molecules and ions with trigonal pyramidal geometry are ammonia\n(NH 3), xenon trioxide, XeO 3, the chlorate ion,\nClO 3â , and the sulfite ion, SO 32â .\nIn organic chemistry, molecules which have a trigonal pyramidal geometry are\nsometimes described as sp 3 hybridized. The AXE method for VSEPR\ntheory states that the classification is AX 3E.\n","linknr":168,"url":"Trigonal_pyramid_(chemistry)","recorded":1362665217,"links":18,"instances":["geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Stereochemistry","Molecular geometry"],"headings":["Trigonal pyramidal geometry in ammonia","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/Phosphine-3D-vdW.png/200px-Phosphine-3D-vdW.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Pyramidal-3D-balls.png/240px-Pyramidal-3D-balls.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["apex","geometry"]],"members":["apex"],"related":["Cyclic_symmetries","Ammonia","Phosphorus_trichloride","Xenon_trioxide","Chemistry","Molecular_geometry","Apex_(geometry)","Trigonal","Molecular_symmetry","Ammonia","Xenon_trioxide","Chlorate","Sulfite","Orbital_hybridisation","AXE_method","Nitrogen","Ammonia","Valence_electron","Octet_rule","Tetrahedron","Inverse_trigonometric_function","Lone_pair","Pyramid","Boron_trifluoride","Trigonal_planar","Boron","Nitrogen_inversion","Claud_E._Cleeton","Neal_H._Williams","Molecular_geometry"]}
