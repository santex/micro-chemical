{"cursor":"4693","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemistry, 'residue' is the material remaining after distillation or an\nevaporation, or to a portion of a larger molecule, such as a methyl group. It\nmay also refer to the undesired byproducts of a reaction. Residue is very\nimportant in the world of chemistry. Residues of distillation are constantly\nanalyzed for quantitative measures. For example, during the distillation of\nwhite wine, after ethanol has been extracted, water and sugar is the main\ningredient of the residue. In this case, the residue is not undesired product.\nThis is important because the residue can be consumed since it tastes very good\nin reality, almost embodying some sort of grape syrup. Also, the residues are\ntested for ethanol for the conclusiveness of the distillation.\n\n\n\nDistillation residue is studied intensely. For example, the effects of chemical\nkinetics on residue curve maps for reactive distillation is a big area of\npotential study that is currently being underwent at University of\nMassachusetts. Because reactive distillation is not advantageous in every case,\nso there is a need for systematic methods to decide when this technique should\nbe used. It is determined by analyzing kinetics of residue formation. This has\nmany uses, for instance, this technique can be used for specific product\nremoval. The study further itself on the effect of kinetics on residue curve\nmaps, which does not need to be further addressed in this section.\n\n\n\nAlso, studies of chemical residues have huge implications on food toxicity.\nAccording to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, food supply is probed for\nchemical contamination caused by chemical residue. For instance, in 2012, a\ntotal of 628 samples were collected and analyzed in dried food category (figs,\ndried dates, corn products, and nut products), and Samples were analyzed for\nresidues using a multi-residue method that detects the Aflatoxins forms B1, B2,\nG1 and G2. Both the levels of the individual forms and the total aflatoxin\nlevels were reported. Most of the samples (584/628 or 93%) did not contain\ndetectable levels of AF. In another food category, residue seems to be causing a\nlot of toxins. In 2011, a total of 288 bottled water samples (Samples consisted\nof spring waters, mineral waters and purified waters from both domestic and\nimported origins.) were randomly selected and tested of bromate residue (a\nresidual chemical compound that can be formed in bottled waters when sufficient\nlevels of bromide are present in waters during disinfection via zonation).\nBromide ions are naturally occurring compounds in water resulting from runoff,\nleaching or seawater intrusion. Bromate is considered to be possibly\ncarcinogenic to humans. Chemical residue is a big problem in food health and\nsafety. The FDA also has clear guidelines on the methods of testing of chemical\nresidues that are possibly dangerous to consume.\n\n\n\nIn biochemistry and molecular biology, a 'residue' refers to a specific monomer\nwithin the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid. For\nexample, one might say, \"This protein consists of 118 amino acid residues\" or\n\"The histidine residue is considered to be basic due to its imidazole ring.\"\nNote that a residue is different from a moiety, which, in the above example\nwould be constituted by the imidazole ring or \"the imidazole moiety\".\n\nNote the origin of this usage: during the process by which monomeric building\nblocks (e.g. amino acids) are strung together into a polymeric chain (e.g. a\nprotein), some material (typically adding up to one molecule of water) is\ndiscarded from each building block, and only a \"residue\" of the building block\nends up in the finished product.\n\nFor instance, a residue is an individual amino acid in a peptide chain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReference: \"Drug & Chemical Residues Methods.\" FDA.gov.
