{"cursor":"7623","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n, freshly sublimed on a cold finger]]\n\n'Sublimation' is the transition of a substance directly from the solid phase to\nthe gas phase without passing through an intermediate liquid phase. Sublimation\nis an endothermic phase transition that occurs at temperatures and pressures\nbelow a substance's triple point in its phase diagram.\n\nAt normal pressures, most chemical compounds and elements possess three\ndifferent states at different temperatures. In these cases, the transition from\nthe solid to the gaseous state requires an intermediate liquid state. Note,\nhowever, that the pressure referred to here is the [[partial pressure]] of the\nsubstance, not the total (e.g., atmospheric) pressure of the entire system. So,\nall solids that possess an appreciable vapor pressure at a certain temperature\nusually can sublime in air (e.g., water ice just below 0Â°C). For some\nsubstances, such as carbon and arsenic, sublimation is much easier than\nevaporation from the melt, because the pressure of their triple point is very\nhigh, and it is difficult to obtain them as liquids.\n\nSublimation requires additional energy and is an endothermic change. The\nenthalpy of sublimation (also called heat of sublimation) can be calculated as\nthe enthalpy of fusion plus the enthalpy of vaporization. The reverse process of\nsublimation is deposition. The formation of frost is an example of\nmeteorological deposition.\n","linknr":382,"url":"Sublimation_(chemistry)","recorded":1362481493,"links":76,"instances":["phase_transition","chemistry","alchemy","alchemist"],"pdf":["http://www.appstate.edu/~perrylb/Research/Snow/Snow_Density/Faasnacht_2004.pdf"],"categories":["Alchemical processes","Laboratory techniques","Separation processes","Atmospheric thermodynamics","Chemical processes","Phase transitions"],"headings":["Examples","Sublimation purification","Historical usage","See also","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/extensions/FlaggedRevs/frontend/modules/img/doc-magnify.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/extensions/FlaggedRevs/frontend/modules/img/arrow-down.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Padlock-silver-light.svg/20px-Padlock-silver-light.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b8/Cp2NiSublimate.jpg/200px-Cp2NiSublimate.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Dry_Ice.jpg/220px-Dry_Ice.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8a/Camphor_sublimation_1.jpg/200px-Camphor_sublimation_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/Ferrocen.jpg/200px-Ferrocen.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a1/Pfeil_SO.svg/20px-Pfeil_SO.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/ChemSepProcDiagram.svg/81px-ChemSepProcDiagram.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Phase_change_-_en.svg/300px-Phase_change_-_en.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phase","matter#phase_diagrams"],["deposition","phase_transition"],["volatility","chemistry"],["george_ripley","alchemist"],["magnum_opus","alchemy"]],"members":["deposition","volatility","phase","magnum_opus","george_ripley"],"related":["Cold_finger","Solid","Gas","Liquid","Endothermic","Phase_transition","Triple_point","Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure","Chemical_compound","Chemical_element","Temperature","Vapor_pressure","Carbon","Arsenic","Evaporation","Endothermic","Enthalpy_of_sublimation","Enthalpy_of_fusion","Enthalpy_of_vaporization","Deposition_(phase_transition)","Frost","Carbon_dioxide","Dry_ice","Atmospheric_pressure","Snow","Ice","Melting_point","Freeze-drying","Snowfield","Ablation","Glacier_ice","Cold_finger","Iodine","Forensic_science","Fingerprint","Naphthalene","Mothball","Arsenic","Ammonium_chloride","Chemist","Chemical_compound","Sublimation_apparatus","Vacuum","Pressure","Volatility_(chemistry)","Cold_finger","Impurities","Alchemy","Retort","Alembic","Basil_Valentine","George_Ripley_(alchemist)","Rosarium_philosophorum","Magnum_opus_(alchemy)","Spagyrics","Ablation","Phase_diagram","Cold_trap","Enthalpy_of_sublimation","Dye-sublimation_printer","Freezer_burn"]}
