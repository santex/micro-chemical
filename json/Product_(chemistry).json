Products are formed as the chemical\nreaction progresses toward chemical equilibrium at a certain reaction rate,\nwhich depends on the reagents and environmental conditions.\n\nDepending on the relative amounts of the reagents and the equilibrium of the\nreaction, the terms \"reagent\" and \"product\" may also overlap.\n\nBut in the end, the product is the result of a chemical reaction.\n\n\n","linknr":104,"url":"Product_(chemistry)","recorded":1362500537,"links":30,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical reactions"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg/30px-Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Chemical_reaction","Reagents","Second_law_of_thermodynamics","Chemical_equilibrium","Reaction_rate","Reagent","Reactant","Chemical_reaction","Chemical_equilibrium","Second_law_of_thermodynamics"]}
