{"cursor":"10307","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n'Filtration' is commonly the mechanical or physical operation which is used for\nthe separation of solids from fluids (liquids or gases) by interposing a medium\nthrough which only the fluid can pass. Oversize solids in the fluid are\nretained, but the separation is not complete; solids will be contaminated with\nsome fluid and filtrate will contain fine particles (depending on the pore size\nand filter thickness). Filtration is also used to describe some biological\nprocesses, especially in water treatment and sewage treatment in which\nundesirable constituents are removed by absorption into a biological film grown\non or in the filter medium as in slow sand filtration.\n","linknr":274,"url":"Filter_(chemistry)","recorded":1362896636,"links":46,"instances":["water_treatment","water"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Analytical chemistry","Laboratory techniques","Unit operations","Alchemical processes","Filtration"],"headings":["Applications","Methods","Filter media","Alternatives","Examples","References","External links","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/FilterDiagram.svg/300px-FilterDiagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/FilterFunnelApparatus.png/240px-FilterFunnelApparatus.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f8/Wiktionary-logo-en.svg/37px-Wiktionary-logo-en.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/ChemSepProcDiagram.svg/81px-ChemSepProcDiagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["backwashing","water_treatment"],["filter","water"]],"members":["backwashing","filter"],"related":["Biology","Water_treatment","Sewage_treatment","Slow_sand_filter","Liquid","Gas","Supercritical_fluid","Solvent","Chemical_engineering","Biofilter","Sieve","Particle_size_distribution","Membrane","Adsorption","Surface_charge","Activated_charcoal","Ion_exchange_resin","Magnetic","Lubrication","Fuel_oils","Separation_of_mixtures","Fluid","Liquid","Gas","Filter_paper","Büchner_funnel","Belt_filter","Rotary_vacuum-drum_filter","Cross-flow_filtration","Screen_filter","Sand_filter","Swimming_pool","Backwashing_(water_treatment)","Screen_filter","Coffee_filter","Pump","Diatomaceous_earth","Silica","Cellulose","Perlite","Slurry","Porosity","Precipitate","Separation_of_mixtures","Decantation","Solution","Centrifugation","Coffee_filter","HEPA","Air_conditioning","Belt_filter","Precious_metals","Mining","Sparkler_Filters","Dust_collector","Büchner_funnel","Filter_paper","Microorganism","Porcelain","Bacterium","Kidney","Renal_filtration","Blood","Glomerulus","Separation_of_mixtures","Microfiltration","Ultrafiltration","Nanofiltration","Reverse_osmosis","Filter_(water)","Crossflow_filtration"]}
