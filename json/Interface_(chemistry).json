The importance\nof the interface depends on which type of system is being treated: the bigger\nthe quotient area/volume, the more effect the surface phenomena will have.\nTherefore interfaces will be considered in systems with big area/volume ratios,\nsuch as colloids.\n\nInterfaces can be spherical or flat, so they can be considered to be always\nspherical with finite or infinite radius. For example oil droplets in a salad\ndressing are spherical but the interface between water and air in a glass of\nwater is mostly flat.\n\nSurface tension is the function which rules interface processes.\n\nInterfaces may cause various optical phenomena, such as refraction. Optical\nlenses serve as an example of a practical application of the interface between\nglass and air.\n\nOne important interface is the gas liquid interface between aerosols and other\natmospheric molecules.\n","linknr":112,"url":"Interface_(chemistry)","recorded":1362482178,"links":24,"instances":["matter","optics","disambiguation"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Colloidal chemistry","Matter"],"headings":["See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ac/Chem_template.svg/32px-Chem_template.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["phase","matter"],["lens","optics"],["membrane","disambiguation"]],"members":["phase","lens","membrane"],"related":["Phase_(matter)","Solid","Liquid","Gas","Vacuum","Colloid","Oil","Salad_dressing","Surface_tension","Optical_phenomena","Refraction","Lens_(optics)","Glass","Surface_tension","Membrane_(disambiguation)","Capillary_surface"]}
