In Chemistry, a homogeneous suspension of material means that\nwhen dividing the volume in half, the same amount of material is suspended in\nboth halves of the substance. However, it might be possible to see the particles\nunder a microscope. An example of a homogeneous mixture is air. Air can be more\nspecifically described as a gaseous solution (oxygen and other gases dissolved\nin the major component, nitrogen). Since interactions between molecules play\nalmost no role, dilute gases form rather trivial solutions. In part of the\nliterature, they are not even classified as solutions.\n","linknr":104,"url":"Homogeneous_(chemistry)","recorded":1362481714,"links":24,"instances":["chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical mixtures"],"headings":["Homogeneity of mixtures","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["suspension","chemistry"]],"members":["suspension"],"related":["Chemical_substances","Heterogeneous","Chemistry","Suspension_(chemistry)","Volume","Microscope","Air","Heat","Filtration","Gravitation","Solution","Centrifuge"]}
