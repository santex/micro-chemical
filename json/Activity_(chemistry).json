{"cursor":"16336","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In chemical thermodynamics, 'activity' (symbol a) is a measure of the âeffective\nconcentrationâ of a species in a mixture, meaning that the species' chemical\npotential depends on the activity of a real solution in the same way that it\nwould depend on concentration for an ideal solution.\n\nBy convention, activity is treated as a dimensionless quantity, although its\nactual value depends on customary choices of standard state for the species. The\nactivity of pure substances in condensed phases (solid or liquids) is normally\ntaken as unity (the number 1). Activity depends on temperature, pressure and\ncomposition of the mixture, among other things. For gases, the effective partial\npressure is usually referred to as fugacity.\n\nThe difference between activity and other measures of composition arises because\nmolecules in non-ideal gases or solutions interact with each other, either to\nattract or to repel each other. The activity of an ion is particularly\ninfluenced by its surroundings.\n\nActivities should be used to define equilibrium constants but, in practice,\nconcentrations are often used instead. The same is often true of equations for\nreaction rates. However, there are circumstances where the activity and the\nconcentration are significantly different and, as such, it is not valid to\napproximate with concentrations where activities are required. Two examples\nserve to illustrate this point: *In a solution of potassium hydrogen iodate at\n0.02 M the activity is 40% lower than the calculated hydrogen ion\nconcentration, resulting in a much higher pH than expected. *When a 0.1 M\nhydrochloric acid solution containing methyl green indicator is added to a\n5 M solution of magnesium chloride, the color of the indicator changes from\ngreen to yellowâindicating increasing acidityâwhen in fact the acid has been\ndiluted. Although at low ionic strength (\n","linknr":239,"url":"Activity_(chemistry)","recorded":1362374679,"links":31,"instances":["mathematics","unit"],"pdf":["http://old.iupac.org/publications/books/gbook/green_book_2ed.pdf"],"categories":["Dimensionless numbers of chemistry","Physical chemistry","Thermodynamics","Thermodynamic properties"],"headings":["Definition","Standard states","Measurement","Use","Example values","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/6/1/e61b0324fa55eb362aa7fee7e437f45b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/c/e/dcee7c497dbb641f25bc70f8590a3cc6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/5/b/55bd10bacb27d8ee361e379bd5befd06.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/0/e/e0eae8cef90439e7f8b3b5d0ac3a0c26.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/5/e/a5e872e94370bc08a4e3edb27cb91024.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/c/d/ecd443654e33f88343a9ba49b78da64b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/c/3/3c3e8d1d46647e30fa5c46c4f50c8842.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/1/1/81154dfd67aed2cadfd5542812f45973.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/e/c/5ecfb92ee06d679b5be87e2924ffcfd4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/0/a/90aec38fb7dff97fc6bd28b3724804ef.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/1/4/6140822a477dbca08d98cc1ea5fafd50.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/6/3/363c2659bae633dc2ec2e5449ef22f08.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/f/f/9fff81b38d5659ff2e14de0bc642e94f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/c/e/dcee7c497dbb641f25bc70f8590a3cc6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/1/9/119e02fe6471d438090e3eaac8cd2caf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/1/5/115cb557c5f00e87815966c2a3b85707.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_edu_science.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["unity","mathematics"],["bar","unit"]],"members":["unity","bar"],"related":["Chemical_thermodynamics","Chemical_species","Chemical_potential","Ideal_solution","Dimensionless_quantity","Standard_state","Unity_(mathematics)","Fugacity","Molecule","Gas","Solution","Ion","Equilibrium_constant","Concentration","Reaction_rate","Potassium_hydrogen_iodate","Molar_concentration","PH","Hydrochloric_acid","Methyl_green","PH_indicator","Magnesium_chloride","Activity_coefficient","Chemical_potential","Standard_state","Gas_constant","Thermodynamic_temperature","Amount_fraction","Molality","Amount_concentration","Henry's_law","Raoult's_law","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","Fugacity","Fugacity","Raoult's_law","Henry's_law","Ion","Debye–Hückel_theory","Pitzer_equations_","Gibbs–Duhem_relation","Colligative_properties","Ion","Debye–Hückel_equation","Davies_equation","Pitzer_equations","Chemical_potential","Temperature","Pressure","Formula","Gas_constant","Solvent","Gas","Partial_pressure","Bar_(unit)","Graphite","Sodium_chloride","Molality","Fugacity","Partial_pressure","Chemical_equilibrium","Electrochemical_potential","Excess_chemical_potential","Partial_molar_property","Thermodynamic_equilibrium"]}
