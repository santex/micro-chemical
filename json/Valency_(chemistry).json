{"cursor":"12311","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\nIn chemistry, 'valence', also known as 'valency' or 'valence number', is the\nnumber of valence bonds Note: A valence bond (or bonding equivalent) is a\ncovalent or ionic bond, formed by the interaction of two bonding\nelectrons. a given atom has formed, or can form, with one or more other\natoms. For most elements the number of bonds can vary. The IUPAC definition\nlimits valence to the maximum number of univalent atoms that may combine with\nthe atom, that is the maximum number of valence bonds that is possible for the\ngiven element. IUPAC Gold Book definition:\n[http://goldbook.iupac.org/V06588.html valence]\n\nThe valence of an element depends on the number of valence electrons that may be\ninvolved in the forming of valence bonds. A 'univalent' (monovalent) atom, ion\nor group has a 'valence of one' and thus can form one covalent bond. A divalent\n[[molecular entity]] has a valence of two and can form two sigma bonds to two\ndifferent atoms or one sigma bond plus one pi bond to a single atom. The Free Dictionary: [http://medical-\ndictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Valence valence] Alkyl groups and\nhydroxyl ions are univalent examples; oxo ligands are divalent.\n\nOver the last century, the concept of valence evolved into a range of approaches\nfor describing the chemical bond, including Lewis structures (1916), valence\nbond theory (1927), molecular orbitals (1928), valence shell electron pair\nrepulsion theory (1958) and all the advanced methods of quantum chemistry.\n\n{|\n|-\n|  || In cyclohexanonoxime (image left), the nitrogen atom has three valence\n|  || bonds and therefore a valence of three.\n|}\n","linknr":566,"url":"Valency_(chemistry)","recorded":1362898223,"links":63,"instances":["periodic_table","chemist"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Chemical bonding","Chemical properties"],"headings":["History","Common valences","Valence versus oxidation state","\"Maximum number of bonds\"  definition","Examples","Maximum valences of the elements","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Cyclohexanonoxime.svg/60px-Cyclohexanonoxime.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/Higgins-particles.jpg/350px-Higgins-particles.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/c/b/5cbaae4d03828c23dfec98f4bd143cee.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Symbol_book_class2.svg/16px-Symbol_book_class2.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/48/Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg/16px-Folder_Hexagonal_Icon.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/fd/Portal-puzzle.svg/16px-Portal-puzzle.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["william_higgins","chemist"],["group","periodic_table"],["mercury(i_chloride"]],"members":["group","william_higgins"],"related":["Chemistry","Valence_bond_theory","Valence_bond_theory","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","IUPAC_Gold_Book","Valence_electron","Covalent_bond","Divalent","Sigma_bond","Pi_bond","Alkyl_group","Hydroxyl","Oxo_ligand","Lewis_structure","Valence_bond_theory","Molecular_orbital","VSEPR_theory","Quantum_chemistry","Oxime","Nitrogen","Etymology","William_Higgins_(chemist)","Valency_bonds","Edward_Frankland","Free_radical","Chemical_affinity","Chemical_formula","Chemical_compound","Irving_Langmuir","Gilbert_N._Lewis","Cubical_atom","Electron","Covalent_bond","Group_(periodic_table)","Periodic_table","Phosphorus","Octet_rule","Alkali_metal","Group_17","Alkaline_earth_metal","Chalcogen","Boron_group","Nitrogen_group","Carbon_group","Chemical_species","Chemical_bond","Cation","Oxidation_number","Coordination_compound","IUPAC","Gold_Book","IUPAC_nomenclature_of_inorganic_chemistry","IUPAC","Gold_Book","Oxidation_state","Oxidation","IUPAC_Gold_Book","Electronegativity","Perchlorate","Ruthenium","Ruthenium_tetroxide","International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry","Hydrogen","Chlorine","Electron_shell","Hypervalent_molecule","Bifluoride","Three-center_four-electron_bond","Three-center_two-electron_bond","Diborane","Hydrogen_chloride","Perchloric_acid","Sodium_hydride","Ferrous_oxide","Ferric_oxide","Crystal_structure","Chlorine","Hydrogen_peroxide","Acetylene","Mercury(I)_chloride","Dichloromethane","List_of_oxidation_states_of_the_elements","Valence_electron","Abegg's_rule","Oxidation_state"]}
