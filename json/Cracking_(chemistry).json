{"cursor":"19331","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In petroleum geology and chemistry, 'cracking' is the process whereby complex\norganic molecules such as kerogens or heavy hydrocarbons are broken down into\nsimpler molecules such as light hydrocarbons, by the breaking of carbon-carbon\nbonds in the precursors. The rate of cracking and the end products are strongly\ndependent on the temperature and presence of catalysts. Cracking is the\nbreakdown of a large alkane into smaller, more useful alkanes and alkenes.\nSimply put, hydrocarbon cracking is the process of breaking long-chain\nhydrocarbons into short ones.\n\nMore loosely, outside the field of petroleum chemistry, the term \"cracking\" is\nused to describe any type of splitting of molecules under the influence of heat,\ncatalysts and solvents, such as in processes of destructive distillation or\npyrolysis.\n\n, Baku, USSR, 1934.]]\n","linknr":319,"url":"Cracking_(chemistry)","recorded":1362580477,"links":44,"instances":["fuel"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Oil refining","Pyrolysis","Organic reactions","Russian inventions","Chemical processes"],"headings":["History and patents","Applications","Diagnostics","Chemistry","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Russian_Cracking.jpg/220px-Russian_Cracking.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/FCC.png/220px-FCC.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["coke","fuel"]],"members":["coke"],"related":["Petroleum_geology","Chemistry","Organic_compound","Molecule","Kerogen","Hydrocarbon","Carbon","Chemical_bond","Reaction_rate","Temperature","Catalyst","Alkane","Alkane","Alkene","Destructive_distillation","Pyrolysis","Baku","USSR","Vladimir_Shukhov","William_Merriam_Burton","Sinclair_Oil_Corporation","Soviet_Union","Ethane","Propane","Butane","Oil_refinery","Liquefied_petroleum_gas","Gasoline","Crude_oil","Fractional_distillation","Gas_oil","Gasoline","Liquified_petroleum_gas","Jet_fuel","Diesel_fuel","Naphtha","Petroleum_coke","Pyrolysis","Ethylene","Delayed_coking","Needle_coke","Electrode","Steel","Aluminium","Gasoline","Catalyst","Aluminium_oxide","Fluidized_bed","High_school","University","Laboratory","Pumice","Aluminium_oxide","Silicon_dioxide","Zeolite","Cyclonic_separation","Fractionation","Naphtha","Oxygen","Endothermic_reaction","Octane_rating","Olefin","Polymer","Fuel_tank","Fuel_injection","Carbon","Isobutane","Alkylation","Polypropylene","Lignite","Leuna","Partial_pressure","Hydrogen","Hydrotreater","Alkanes","Ethane","Isoparaffin","Hydrocarbon","Aromatics","Olefin","Naphthene","Alkane","Jet_fuel","Diesel_fuel","Sulfur","Contaminant","Kerosene","Gasoline","Petrochemical","Hydrocarbon","Alkene","Olefin","Ethene","Ethylene","Propene","Propylene","Naphtha","Liquified_petroleum_gas","Ethane","Speed_of_sound","Heat_exchanger","Ethane","Naphtha","Butadiene","Aromatic_hydrocarbon","Gasoline","Fuel_oil","Ethene","Benzene","Propene","Coke_(fuel)","Carbon","Free_radical","Acid","Catalyst","Silica-alumina","Zeolite","Ion","Carbocation","Hydride","Anion","Beta_scission","Intramolecular","Intermolecular","Hydride_transfer","Shukhov_cracking_process","Vladimir_Shukhov","William_Merriam_Burton","C.P._Dubbs","Universal_Oil_Products","Oil_refinery","Homolysis","Alkenes","Polymers","Chemical_reaction","Free_radical","Computer","Simulation","Chemical_bond","Hydrogen","Alkene","Alkene","Alkene","Fossil_fuel_reforming"]}
