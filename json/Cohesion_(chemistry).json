This is an intrinsic property of a\nsubstance that is caused by the shape and structure of its molecules which\nmakes the distribution of orbiting electrons irregular when molecules get close\nto one another, creating electrical attraction that can maintain a macroscopic\nstructure such as a water drop. In other words, cohesion allows for surface\ntension, creating a \"solid-like\" state upon which light (in weight) or high\ndensity materials can be placed.\n\n exhibits more cohesion than adhesion with glass]] Water, for example, is\n strongly cohesive as each molecule may make four hydrogen bonds to other water\n molecules in a tetrahedral configuration. This results in a relatively strong\n Coulomb force between molecules. In simple terms, the polarity (state of which\n a molecule is oppositely charged on its poles) of water molecules allow them to\n be attracted towards each other. In the case of a water molecule, the hydrogen\n atoms carry a relative positive charges in comparison to the oxygen atom. This\n charge polarization within the molecule allows it to align with adjacent\n molecules through strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, rendering the bulk\n liquid cohesive. Van der Waals gases such as methane, however, have weak\n cohesion due only to Van der Waals forces that operate by induced polarity in\n non-polar molecules.\n\nCohesion, along with adhesion (attraction between unlike molecules), helps\nexplain phenomena such as meniscus, surface tension and capillary action.\n\nMercury in a glass flask is a good example of the effects of the ratio between\ncohesive and adhesive forces. Because of its high cohesion and low adhesion to\nthe glass, mercury does not spread out to cover the top of the flask, and if\nenough is placed in the flask to cover the bottom, it exhibits a strongly\nmeniscus, where the meniscus of water is .
