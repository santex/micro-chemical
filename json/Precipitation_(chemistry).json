{"cursor":"8253","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Precipitation}}\n\n\n\n'Precipitation' is the formation of a solid in a solution or inside another\nsolid during a chemical reaction or by diffusion in a solid. When the reaction\noccurs in a liquid, the solid formed is called the 'precipitate'. The chemical\nthat causes the solid to form is called the 'precipitant'. Without sufficient\nforce of gravity (settling) to bring the solid particles together, the\nprecipitate remains in suspension. After sedimentation, especially when using a\ncentrifuge to press it into a compact mass, the precipitate may be referred to\nas a 'pellet'. The precipitate-free liquid remaining above the solid is called\nthe 'supernate' or 'supernatant'. Powders derived from precipitation have also\nhistorically been known as '[[flowers]]'.\n\nPrecipitation may occur if the concentration of a compound exceeds its\nsolubility (such as when mixing solvents or changing their temperature).\nPrecipitation may occur rapidly from a supersaturated solution.\n\nIn solids, precipitation occurs if the concentration of one solid is above the\nsolubility limit in the host solid, due to e.g. rapid quenching or ion\nimplantation, and the temperature is high enough that diffusion can lead to\nsegregation into precipitates. Precipitation in solids is routinely used to\nsynthesize nanoclusters.\n\nAn important stage of the precipitation process is the onset of nucleation. The\ncreation of a hypothetical solid includes the formation of an interface, which\nrequires some energy based on the relative surface energy of the solid and the\nsolution. If this energy is not available, and no suitable nucleation surface is\navailable, supersaturation occurs.\n","linknr":211,"url":"Precipitation_(chemistry)","recorded":1362486037,"links":43,"instances":["chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Separation processes","Chemical processes"],"headings":["Applications","Representation using chemical equations","Precipitate colors","Cation sensitivity","Digestion","References","Further reading","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Chemical_precipitation_diagram.svg/220px-Chemical_precipitation_diagram.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/65/Tetratolylporphyrin.jpg/220px-Tetratolylporphyrin.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/Precipitation_of_Silver_on_Copper_1.jpg/220px-Precipitation_of_Silver_on_Copper_1.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/H2TPPsyn.png/400px-H2TPPsyn.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["suspension","chemistry"],["interface","chemistry"],["energy","chemistry"],["workup","chemistry"],["dissociation","chemistry"]],"members":["energy","interface","workup","dissociation","suspension"],"related":["Solid","Solution","Chemical_reaction","Diffusion","Settling","Suspension_(chemistry)","Sedimentation","Laboratory_centrifuge","History_of_chemistry","Solubility","Supersaturated","Ion_implantation","Nucleation","Interface_(chemistry)","Energy_(chemistry)","Surface_energy","Pigments","Salts","Water_treatment","Classical_qualitative_inorganic_analysis","Workup_(chemistry)","Crystallization","Porphyrin","Propionic_acid","Filtration","Decanting","Centrifugation","Acetonitrile","Ethanol_precipitation","DNA","Metallurgy","Solid_solution","Precipitation_strengthening","Solid_solution_strengthening","Silver_nitrate","Potassium_chloride","Silver_chloride","Dissociation_(chemistry)","Ions","Ionic_equation","Spectator_ions","Cation","Salt","Alkali","Hydroxide","Temperature","Ostwald_ripening"]}
