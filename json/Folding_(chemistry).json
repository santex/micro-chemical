The process can also be described as 'intramolecular self-\nassembly', a type of molecular self-assembly, where the molecule is directed to\nform a specific shape through noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen\nbonding, metal coordination, hydrophobic forces, van der Waals forces, pi-pi\ninteractions, and/or electrostatic effects.\n\nThe most active area of interest in the folding of molecules is the process of\nprotein folding, which is the shape that is assumed by a specific sequence of\namino acids in a protein. The shape of the folded protein can be used to\nunderstand its function and design drugs to influence the processes that it is\ninvolved in.\n\nThere is also a great deal of interest in the construction of artificial folding\nmolecules or foldamers. They are studied as models of biological molecules and\npotential application to the development of new functional materials.\n","linknr":93,"url":"Folding_(chemistry)","recorded":1362560624,"links":12,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Supramolecular chemistry","Self-organization","Stereochemistry"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Lehn_Beautiful_Foldamer_HelvChimActa_1598_2003.jpg/200px-Lehn_Beautiful_Foldamer_HelvChimActa_1598_2003.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Jean-Marie_Lehn","Chemistry","Conformational_isomerism","Molecular_self-assembly","Noncovalent_interactions","Hydrogen_bond","Hydrophobic_effect","Van_der_Waals_force","Pi-pi_interaction","Protein_folding","Amino_acids","Foldamers","Secondary_structure","Tertiary_structure"]}
