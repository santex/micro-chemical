{"cursor":"27227","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n (1866-1947), the founder of radical chemistry]] In chemistry, a 'radical' (more\n precisely, a 'free radical') is an atom, molecule, or ion that has unpaired\n valence electrons or an open electron shell, and therefore may be seen as\n having one or more \"dangling\" covalent bonds.\n\nWith some exceptions, these \"dangling\" bonds make free radicals highly\nchemically reactive towards other substances, or even towards themselves: their\nmolecules will often spontaneously dimerize or polymerize if they come in\ncontact with each other. Most radicals are reasonably stable only at very low\nconcentrations in inert media or in vacuum.\n\nA notable example of free radical is the hydroxyl radical (HOâ¢), a molecule that\nis one hydrogen atom short of a water molecule and thus has one bond \"dangling\"\nfrom the oxygen. Two other examples are the carbene molecule (':'), which has\ntwo dangling bonds; and the superoxide anion (â¢), the oxygen molecule with one\nextra electron, which has one dangling bond. On the other hand, the hydroxyl\nanion (), the oxide anion () and the carbenium cation () are not radicals, since\nthe bonds that may appear to be dangling are in fact resolved by the addition or\nremoval of electrons.\n\nFree radicals may be created in a number of ways, including synthesis with very\ndilute or rarefied reagents, reactions at very low temperatures, or breakup of\nlarger molecules. The latter can be affected by any process that puts enough\nenergy into the parent molecule, such as ionizing radiation, heat, electrical\ndischarges, electrolysis, and chemical reactions. Indeed, radicals are\nintermediate stages in many chemical reactions.\n\nFree radicals play an important role in combustion, atmospheric chemistry,\npolymerization, plasma chemistry, biochemistry, and many other chemical\nprocesses. In living organisms, the free radicals superoxide and nitric oxide\nand their reaction products regulate many processes, such as control of vascular\ntone and thus blood pressure. They also play a key role in the intermediary\nmetabolism of various biological compounds. Such radicals can even be messengers\nin a process dubbed redox signaling. A radical may be trapped within a [[Cage\neffect (chemistry)|solvent cage]] or be otherwise bound.\n\nUntil late in the 20th century the word \"radical\" was used in chemistry to\nindicate any connected group of atoms, such as a methyl group or a carboxyl,\nwhether it was part of a larger molecule or a molecule on its own. The qualifier\n\"free\" was then needed to specify the unbound case. Following recent\nnomenclature revisions, a part of a larger molecule is now called a functional\ngroup or substituent, and \"radical\" now implies \"free\". However, the old\nnomenclature may still occur in the literature.\n","linknr":434,"url":"Radical_(chemistry)","recorded":1362508285,"links":58,"instances":["chemistry","physics","physics","chemistry"],"pdf":["http://www.chembio.uoguelph.ca/oakley/papers/rto_086.pdf","http://www.chembio.uoguelph.ca/oakley/papers/rto_086.pdf"],"categories":["Biological processes","Biomolecules","Chemical bonding","Environmental chemistry","Free radicals","Senescence"],"headings":["History","Depiction in chemical reactions","Formation","Persistence and stability","Reactivity","Combustion","Polymerization","Atmospheric radicals","In biology","Loose definition of radicals","Diagnostics","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/Gombergm01.jpg/220px-Gombergm01.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/e/e/9ee54f50fd24e9be6bc62011161f3024.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Radical.svg/300px-Radical.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/VitE.gif","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b2/Spectrum_of_blue_flame.png/350px-Spectrum_of_blue_flame.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["plasma","physics"],["spin","physics"],["raft","chemistry"],["atrp","chemistry"],["2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane_dihydrochloride"]],"members":["atrp","plasma","spin","raft"],"related":["Chemistry","Atom","Molecule","Ion","Unpaired_electron","Open_shell","Covalent_bond","Chemical_reaction","Dimer","Polymer","Hydroxyl_radical","Hydrogen","Methylene_radical","Superoxide","Anion","Hydroxyl","Oxide","Carbenium","Ionizing_radiation","Electrolysis","Combustion","Atmospheric_chemistry","Polymerization","Plasma_(physics)","Biochemistry","Superoxide","Nitric_oxide","Redox_signaling","Methyl","Carboxyl","Functional_group","Substituent","Triphenylmethyl_radical","Moses_Gomberg","University_of_Michigan","Functional_group","Methanol","Mass_spectrometry","Reaction_mechanism","Homolysis","Radical_addition","Radical_substitution","Reactive_intermediate","Homolysis","Bond_dissociation_energy","Bond_cleavage","Organic_peroxide","Quantum_chemistry","Exothermic_reaction","Radical_ion","Redox","Superoxide","Electron_transport_chain","Dioxygen","Nitric_oxide","Tocopherol","Vitamin_E","Thiazyl","Resonance_stabilization","Steric_effects","Triphenylmethyl_radical","Fremy's_salt","Nitroxide","TEMPO","TEMPOL","Oxidative_stress","Diradical","Triplet_oxygen","Quantum_chemistry","Paramagnetism","Carbocations","Conjugate_addition","Maleic_anhydride","Styrene","Carbene","Nitrene","Swan_bands","Combustion","Oxygen","Diradical","Spin_(physics)","Ground_state","Triplet_oxygen","Singlet_oxygen","Energy_barrier","Forbidden_mechanism","Flammability","Combustion","Tetraethyl_lead","Engine_knocking","Preignition","Hydroperoxyl","Organic_hydroperoxide","Hydroxyl_radical","Polymerization","Radical_polymerization","Living_polymerization","RAFT_(chemistry)","ATRP_(chemistry)","Photodissociation","Nitrogen_dioxide","Nitric_oxide","Photochemical_smog","Chlorofluorocarbon","Ultraviolet_radiation","Ozone","Catalytic","Chain_reaction","Ozone_depletion","Ozone_layer","Refrigerant","Granulocyte","Macrophage","Signal_transduction","Redox_signaling","Superoxide","Hydroxyl_radical","Death","Cancer","Stroke","Myocardial_infarction","Diabetes","Cancer","DNA","Mutation","Cell_cycle","Senescence","Atherosclerosis","Alcohol","Liver","Cigarette","Smoke","Alpha_1-antitrypsin","Lung","Emphysema","Parkinson's_disease","Deafness","Schizophrenia","Alzheimer's","Hemochromatosis","Melanin","Free-radical_theory","Senescence","Hormesis","Enzyme","Superoxide_dismutase","Catalase","Glutathione_peroxidase","Glutathione_reductase","Antioxidant","Vitamin_A","Vitamin_C","Vitamin_E","Polyphenol_antioxidant","Bilirubin","Uric_acid","Red_blood_cell","Purine","Jaundice","Gout","Reactive_oxygen_species","Superoxide","Hydrogen_peroxide","Hydroxyl_radical","Oxygen","Spectroscopy","Chemical_reaction","Astrochemistry","Gerhard_Herzberg","Electron_spin_resonance","Electron_paramagnetic_resonance","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","Magnetic_field","Nuclear_magnetic_resonance","CIDNP","Nitric_oxide","DPPH","X-ray_photoelectron_spectroscopy","Absorption_spectroscopy","TBARS","Amino_acid","Tyrosine","Tyrosine","Tyrosine","Glutathione","2,2'-Azobis(2-amidinopropane)_dihydrochloride","Oxidation","Drug","Azo_compound","Small_molecule","Protein","Glutathione","Chemical_trap","-yl","Electron_pair","Globally_Harmonized_System_of_Classification_and_Labelling_of_Chemicals","Hofmann-Löffler_reaction"]}
